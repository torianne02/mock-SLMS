# Mock-SLMS
Welcome to *Mock-SLMS*, a student learning management system built with Sinatra, a Ruby framework. 

## Installation
You can install this app by cloning this repository using the command  `git clone https://github.com/torianne02/mock-SLMS.git`

## Usage
After cloning the repository, change directory by running `cd mock-SLMS/`.
Then, run the following:
```ruby
bundle install
shotgun
```
Then, follow the listening port listed in the terminal.

## Explanation of Logic
#### Framework Choice
When I first started this project I originally was going to jump into Rails, but have never built a Rails application without a database before. I knew that Sinatra would give me the freedom I needed to work without a database and ActiveRecord. 

#### Testing
I did not get as far as I would have liked. I wanted to implement tests but have only done so before in a Rails application with RSpec. I attempted to go this route and wasted 10 minutes trying to figure out how to configure it so I decided to move on. I do apologize for not using proper TDD techniques. 

#### Controller and Model Logic
Unfortonutely I did not get as far as I would have liked. The HTTP requests are not working properly. I started to feel the time crunch and started working on logic so you could see that. I do apologize for not having a semi-completed project by the deadline. 

## Thanks
Thank you so much for considering me for this position. Time crunched tests are, unfortunately, not where I shine, but I really do like Udacity and the mission that y'all have set forth. I would be honored to move forward in the interviewing process.
